# Shadertoy-Port
A renderer made from scratch in C++ using OpenGL that was created to run and display my ShaderToy projects. The focus of this project is to showcase my skills and knowledge in GLSL and to bridge the gap between learning OpenGL and learning the shader language. 

# Features
- Ray Marching
- Ambient Occlusion
- Reflections
- Blinn-Phong Lighting
- Specular Normalization
- Anti-Aliasing "RGSS"
- Soft Shadows
- Fresnel Shading
- Noise
- IOR (Index of Refraction)

# Display

**Different materials with different gloss and IoR values.**

# Goals
- Better way to implement the IoR and Gloss values
- Cook-Torrance Lighting
- Water Shader
