# Shadertoy-Port
A renderer made from scratch in C++ using OpenGL that was created to run my ShaderToy fragment shaders. This was created to bridge the gap between learning OpenGL and learning raw GLSL with different rendering and lighting methods.

It currently features Ray Marching, Blinn-Phong lighting, Specular Normalization, Ambient Occlusion, Anti-aliasing "RGSS", Soft Shadows, Fresnel shading, and Reflections.
