# Shadertoy-Port
A rendered that can display my ShaderToy projects. This was more to show the different rendering and lighting methods I've learned in raw GLSL.
The focus of this project is to showcase my skills and knowledge in shaders and to bridge the gap between this and learning OpenGL in my Renderer project.

# Features
- [x] Ray Marching
- [x] Ambient Occlusion
- [x] Reflections
- [x] Blinn-Phong Lighting
- [x] Specular Normalization
- [x] Anti-Aliasing "RGSS"
- [x] Soft Shadows
- [x] Fresnel Shading
- [x] Brownian Noise
- [ ] Refraction (To be honest the IOR isn't working properly so I'll leave this unchecked until I actually understand)

# Goals
[ ] Better way to implement the IoR and Gloss values
[ ] Improve reflections so they can bounce multiple times properly
[ ] Cook-Torrance Lighting
[ ] Ray Tracing
[ ] Water Shader
