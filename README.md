# Shadertoy-Port
A renderer made with OpenGL and C++ that can run my ShaderToy fragment shaders. This was created to bridge the gap in the time I spend learning OpenGL and raw GLSL. I am currently working on improving the raymarched reflections and hope to add volumetric figures to the scene.

It currently features Ray Marching, Blinn-Phong lighting, Specular Normalization, Ambient Occlusion, Anti-aliasing "RGSS", Soft Shadows, Fresnel shading, and Reflections.
